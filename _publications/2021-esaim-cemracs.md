In this paper, we analyze the relevance of the use of the shallow water model and the Boussinesq model to simulate tsunamis generated by a landslide. In a first part, we determine if the two models are able to reproduce waves generated by a landslide. Each model has drawbacks but it seems that it is possible to use them together to improve the simulations. In a second part we try to recover the landslide displacement from the generated wave. This problem is formulated as a minimization problem and we limit the number of parameters to determine assuming that the bottom can be well described by an empirical law.
